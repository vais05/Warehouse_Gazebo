# Warehouse_Gazebo
Inspired by Kiva robots, L1Br simulates a warehouse robot in Gazebo. It moves under shelves, lifts trays, adapts speed, and monitors sensors. A 135° laser sensor prevents collisions, while a bottom camera reads QR codes for localization. Wheel odometry and IMU further enhance realistic navigation.
